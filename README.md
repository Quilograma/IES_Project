## Abstract

The idea is to monitor website traffic on several pages of a B2C e-commerce
company. Besides some insights conveyed through standard analytics, we are
also interested in training machine learning models to predict how many hits
will a page receive in the next hours/days/weeks and so on. Website traffic
data mining and forecasting can help businesses to improve informed decisionmaking according to forbes. Specifically, forecasting incoming page hits is key
to allocate server resources, reducing slowness, which may affect the customer
experience. Having said that, machine learning models may deteriorate over
time due to distribution shifts, requiring, therefore, monitoring and retraining
(MLOps).
